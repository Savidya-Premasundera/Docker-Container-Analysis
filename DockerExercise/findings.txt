Docker containers operate in an isolated environment, but they still share some resources (ex: file system, network resources, etc.) with the host system. Containers operate within their own isolated network, but can be configured to share network interfaces with the host and each other through shared networking configurations. For instance, in this exercise, Service1 is accessible from the host via port 8199 while Service2 communicates internally. Each container has its own process space and can only see the processes running within that container. Containers maintain isolation in terms of processes, namespaces, and their environment to achieve a separation similar to a virtual machine.
